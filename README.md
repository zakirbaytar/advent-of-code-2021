# Advent of Code 2021

> [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2021) is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as a speed contest, interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, or to challenge each other.

Made by [Eric Wastl](http://was.tl/), who also made Vanilla JS, PHP Sadness, and lots of other things. Make sure to check out his [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ericwastl) and [GitHub](https://github.com/topaz).
